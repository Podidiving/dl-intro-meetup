# DL intro meetup

---

- for theoretical intro see `DL_intro.md` or `DL_intro.pdf` (I'd prefer to use `md`, `pdf` is kinda clumsy)
- for practice use [notebook](GPT_From_Scratch.ipynb) (or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/podidiving/dl-intro-meetup/blob/main/GPT_From_Scratch.ipynb)) and also see `scripts`
